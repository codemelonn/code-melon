                Hi, I’m Amara Barton, and I am a senior computer science student. 
                I’m into a lot of different things—math, crocheting, knitting, sewing, 
                and I even bake and roller skate when I get the chance. 
                I love picking up new hobbies, so I’ve ended up learning how to do all sorts of things,
                and in the best way have they been so rewarding. 
                I considered for a while what career I would follow and 
                I knew that it would have to have something to do with structure. 
                Thus, I considered becoming a math major, and rather than subject myself to that turmoil, 
                I decided that computer science would suffice! 
                Coding has now become a large part of my life and I have no regrets. 
                Although coding is a big part of my life, I also really enjoy music, 
                movies, and TV shows. Food is another passion of mine; I’m always up for trying new things, 
                and thankfully my partner is an amazing cook!
                My beagle, Honie, is my best friend and keeps me company through all my adventures. She is one of the greatest things to ever happen to me, and being her companion is something that I hold very dear to me.
